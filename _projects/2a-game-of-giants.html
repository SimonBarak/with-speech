<p>
  Billions of years ago, some single-celled creatures realized that being just
  one cell left your options pretty limited.
</p>
<p>
  <img

  />
</p>

<p>
  So they figured out a cool trick. By joining together with other single cells,
  they could form a giant creature that had all kinds of new advantages.
</p>
<p>The downside was a major loss of individuality—</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone  wp-image-7439"

  />
</p>

<p>
  —but the survival benefits made it worth the sacrifice, and the multi-celled
  organism thing stuck.
</p>
<p>
  A single cell is itself a giant—a magical living giant made up of trillions of
  non-living atoms—and an animal is a higher-level giant made up of trillions of
  cells. This concept—a bunch of smaller things joining together to form a giant
  that can function as more than the sum of its parts—is called
  <em>emergence.</em> We can visualize it as a tower.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone  wp-image-7440"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/15.1-Emergence-bottom-600x600.png"

    height="550"
    sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  Pretty soon after cells started joining together to form animals, some of the
  animals discovered that they could go up <em>another</em> level of emergence
  and form even bigger giants made up of multiple animals. If you look around,
  you’ll see them everywhere—schools of fish, packs of wolves, colonies of ants,
  waddles of penguins. Groups like these represent floors of Emergence Tower
  <em>above </em>that of the individual animal level.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone wp-image-7441"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/15.2-Emergence-wolves-ants.png"
    alt=""
    width="850"
    height="591"
    sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  The ancestors of the single-celled organisms that joined together to form the
  first sponges were able to survive on their own. But once evolution shaped
  their descendants into parts of something bigger, there was no turning back.
  You could try pulling a cell out of a sponge and telling it to go rogue, but
  it had lost that ability. On its own, it would die.
</p>
<p>
  When most of us consider what constitutes a complete life form and what
  doesn’t, it usually comes down to independence. We think of the sponge as a
  life form, but we think of each of its cells as mere <em>parts</em> of a life
  form. Meanwhile, there are other single cells—like an amoeba—that we do think
  of as full life forms. The key distinction in both cases is independence.
</p>
<p>
  There’s no reason this concept shouldn’t apply across the board. Isolate an
  ant from its colony and it’ll suffer the same fate as the extracted sponge
  cell—so why do we think of the ant as the life form and the colony as simply a
  community of those life forms?
</p>
<p>
  Probably because each of us is an animal. So we’re biased to think of the
  animal as the key level along Emergence Tower—the point where the primary
  “life form” always exists.
</p>
<p>
  <img

    height="608"
    sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  If we’re not being animal-centric, though, we should probably put an ant in
  the same category as a sponge <em>cell</em>, and the ant <em>colony</em> in
  the same category as the sponge. The ant <em>colony</em> is really the
  independent life form in the ant world—the individual ant is just one of the
  units of emergence beneath it.
</p>

  />
</p>

<p>
  Since the dawn of human evolution, humans have been forming giants called
  tribes. In my head, an ancient human tribe looks something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone  wp-image-7445"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/16.1-tribe-464x600.png"
    alt=""
    width="433"
    height="560"
    sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  As is usually the case with emergent phenomena, a human giant is greater than
  the sum of its parts.
</p>
<p>
  In Chapter 1, we discussed how each human has two “minds”—the Primitive Mind
  with its fiery flame and the Higher Mind with his orb of clarity and
  consciousness. So when humans band together, they can generate a
  <em>double </em>emergence phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
  The Primitive Mind is all about making giants. In fact, one of the Primitive
  Mind’s central talents is the ability to instinctually merge with other
  Primitive Minds, combining each of their individual primal flames into a
  raging survival bonfire, making the group stronger and more powerful than the
  sum of its parts.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7446"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/16.2-tribe-with-fire-600x375.jpg"
    alt=""
    width="600"
    height="375"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7447"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/16.3-merged-fire-600x375.jpg"
    alt=""
    width="600"
    height="375"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  But when Higher Minds work together, the effect can be just as powerful: the
  group as a whole gains superhuman abilities in learning and creativity and
  discovery.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7448"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/16.5-tribe-with-staffs-600x399.jpg"
    alt=""
    width="600"
    height="399"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  Combining both emergent properties made the human tribe an incredible survival
  machine that allowed the species to stay afloat and thrive in a relentless
  natural world.
</p>
<p>
  For most early humans, forming into giants with other humans wasn’t just an
  advantage, it was a necessity. A couple with little children living alone in a
  forest in 50,000 BC would have had a hell of a time doing all the hunting,
  gathering, fire-making, cooking, breast-feeding, and migrating they needed to
  do to fulfill their basic family needs, all while raising kids. And even if
  they somehow managed this for a while, they’d be a pretty soft target for
  animal predators and for human tribes who wanted their resources, and their
  kids wouldn’t have many dating options down the road. For all these reasons,
  ancient humans were tribe dependent.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, on the ancient landscape—the one we were designed for—the
  human being wasn’t really the independent life form of the human race. The
  tribe was.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone wp-image-7449"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/15.5-Emergence-tribe-life-form-400x600.png"
    alt=""
    width="450"
    height="675"
    sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  This idea may explain a whole lot about people and about the world around us,
  and it’s something we’re going to talk a lot about in this series. If we
  wanted to understand why ants evolved to be the way they are, we’d want to
  think about the evolution of their independent life form: the colony. The
  individual ant wasn’t shaped by evolution to be the perfect survival
  creature—it was shaped by evolution to be just the right element of a perfect
  survival colony. That’s why ants happily sacrifice their lives to protect the
  colony during an attack.
</p>
<p>
  If we want to understand why people are the way they are, we should try
  thinking the same way. A human isn’t simply a perfect survival creature—it’s
  also just the right element of a perfect survival tribe. Examining the traits
  of a perfect survival tribe can help us see the specs for human nature, not
  only illuminating who we are, but <em>why </em>we’re that way.
</p>
<h3><strong>Ants and Spiders</strong></h3>
<p>
  For the human genetic line, sustenance was a survival requirement, so we
  evolved to be hungry. Reproduction was a survival requirement, so we evolved
  to be horny. Not falling off a cliff was a survival requirement, so we evolved
  to be scared of heights. Tribe well-being was a survival requirement, so we
  evolved to be tribal.
</p>
<p>But what exactly does it mean to be tribal?</p>
<p>
  To me, someone is being tribal when they’re thinking and behaving more like a
  piece of a larger organism than as an independent organism themselves.
</p>
<p>
  Under this definition, ants are tribal as fuck. They’re furiously loyal. They
  always put the team first. The ants I’ve gotten to know in my life have a long
  list of bad personal qualities, but “individual selfishness” isn’t one of
  them.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, two rival spiders will compete with each other ruthlessly, both
  entirely self-interested.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone  wp-image-7450"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/16b-spider-fight-600x169.png"
    alt=""
    width="552"
    height="155"
    sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px"
  />
</p>

<p>So what’s the deal? Are ants better people than spiders are?</p>
<p>
  Ant behavior seems pretty different than spider behavior—until we remember
  that the two species have different relationships with Emergence Tower. For
  spiders, the “independent life form” lives on the level of the individual
  animal. For ants, independence happens a few floors up.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    class="alignnone wp-image-7451"
    src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/15.5a-emergence-ant-spider.png"
    alt=""
    width="1000"
    height="574"
    sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  Comparing the behavior of individual spiders to individual ants is comparing
  the behavior of one independent life form to the behavior of the
  <em>cells</em> of another independent life form. Cells of a life form tend to
  be highly cooperative with each other—that doesn’t tell you much about whether
  or not the life form itself likes to cooperate with other life forms.
</p>
<p>
  If we look at ant behavior up on the colony level of Emergence Tower, they
  don’t look so nice anymore. Colonies aren’t especially into cooperating with
  or sharing their food with other colonies, and as many 2:45am YouTube spirals
  have taught me, they will not hesitate to pillage and murder members of
  another colony if it helps their colony. Ant colonies are big, selfish
  creatures—individual ants are just the cells of that creature.
</p>
<p>
  In the human world, we think of “Me vs. You” selfishness and “Us vs. Them”
  tribalism as different concepts, but they’re actually just the same phenomenon
  happening on different parts of Emergence Tower. Spider dickishness comes in
  the form of “Me vs. You” selfishness because the spider is the independent
  life form. Ant dickishness comes in the form of “Us vs. Them” tribalism
  because the ant colony is the independent life form. Tribalism is just what
  selfishness looks like up on the group level.
</p>
<p>
  The human Primitive Mind isn’t any nicer than the spider or ant Primitive
  Mind—but it is a bit more complicated. Unlike spiders and ants, whose
  independent life form never changes emergence floors, humans are a kind of
  hybrid creature that inhabits a <em>range</em> along Emergence Tower, not a
  single floor.
</p>
<p>

    height="563"
    sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"
  />
</p>

<p>
  We can be like spiders sometimes and like ants other times. Our independent
  life form makes trips up and down Emergence Tower’s <em>elevator</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Human evolution has driven our use of this elevator, striking what’s probably
  an optimal balance for maximum genetic survival.
</p>
<h3><strong>Me against my brother </strong></h3>
<p>
  Of all the factors that affect our emergence mindset, one of the most reliable
  is conflict.
</p>
<p>
  When my tortoise Winston is scared, he tucks his head and his limbs into his
  shell. When humans are scared, they form giants. The giant is the human
  tortoise shell. Typically, the bigger the giant that threatens a group of
  people, the bigger a giant they’ll form in response.
</p>
<p>
  Psychologist Jonathan Haidt likes to point out an old Bedouin proverb that
  nails this idea. It goes:
</p>
<p>
  <em
    >Me against my brothers; my brothers and me against my cousins; my cousins,
    my brothers, and me against strangers.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  When I hear this proverb, I see a human taking a ride up the Emergence Tower
  elevator.

<p>
  At the beginning of the comic, the psychology of the two brothers was centered
  on the individual human floor. With no larger conflict happening, they acted a
  lot like two competing spiders. But selfish spider behavior is a luxury of
  safe times, and as other groups entered the scene, the brothers had bigger
  problems on their hands than their dislike of each other. Their psyches rose
  up on the emergence elevator, and by the middle of the comic, everyone was
  acting more like ants than spiders. Towards the end of the comic, as the
  threat levels went down, higher tribalism melted away and things became less
  ant-like—the elevator came back downwards.
</p>
<p>
  If you pay attention to the world around you, and to your own psychology,
  you’ll spot the elevator in action. Ever notice how countries in one region of
  the world will often despise each other, focusing most of their national
  dickishness on each other—until there’s a broader conflict or war in play, at
  which time they put aside their differences? How different sects of a religion
  in fierce conflict with each other will suddenly find common ground when a
  rival religion or other outside entity insults or threatens their religion as
  a whole? How about when rivalries in the world of club soccer become less
  heated during the World Cup? Or when political factions with differing or even
  totally contradictory ideologies start marching in the street, arm in arm,
  during a national election or mass movement? I saw the elevator shoot upwards
  in the days following 9/11, when millions of New Yorkers who normally can’t
  stand each other were holding doors for each other, showing concern for each
  other’s well-being, and even hugging each other in the street. I remember
  thinking that while an alien attack would suck overall, it would do wonders
  for species solidarity.
</p>
<p>
  In each case, human dickishness is running at full force—the thing that’s
  changing is the size of the giants that are being dicks to each other.
</p>
<p>
  Human evolution has probably been influenced by the entire human emergence
  range. We were shaped partially by our spider interactions as we competed with
  neighboring individuals and partially by our ant interactions as our tribes
  competed with neighboring tribes. In other words, to survive through human
  history, it makes sense that our genes had to be good at competing as an
  individual against their brother <em>and </em>competing with their family
  against other families <em>and </em>competing with their tribe against other
  tribes.<span>3</span>
</p>
<h3><strong>The right element of a perfect survival tribe</strong></h3>
<p>
  Our society today is, in its own way, still a game of giants. To understand
  the world around us, you can’t think only about people as individuals—we need
  to get to know the tribal mindset. So what are some elements of a tribal
  mindset?
</p>
<p>
  There are classic “Us &gt; Them” traits, like our
  <strong>respect for loyalty</strong>—the feeling that being loyal is a
  critical virtue and nothing is worse than being a traitor.
</p>
<p>
  Or the way we view others. Our tendency to
  <strong>lionize members of Us and demonize members of Them</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the most tribal traits come in the form of “Us &gt; Me”—as if the
  tribal mindset is in direct competition with the me-first selfish mindset.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes it shows up as <strong>a love of conformity.</strong> A literal
  “selflessness.” The inclination to fit in at the expense of your
  individuality. A susceptibility to groupthink over individual reasoning. A
  fear of standing out or being disliked and a disdain for those who diverge
  from group conformity. A very ant-y way to be.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes it shows up as <strong>an affinity for social hierarchy</strong>—a
  deference to authority and the inclination to suck up to those in power.
</p>
<p>
  Or<strong> reverence for self-sacrifice. </strong>The feeling that the most
  noble thing someone can do is sacrifice their life in service of Us as a whole
  or in order to save another group member. And deep contempt for anyone who
  looks out for themselves in battle or behaves selfishly within the tribe.
</p>
<p>
  But the tribal quality that I find most fascinating is what I might call
  <strong>selective kindness.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To see how selective kindness works, let’s visit with three ancient tribes—one
  made up of people who are never kind, one made of people who are selectively
  kind, and one full of people who are always kind.

  Okay well that was bad for Tribe A. The tribe was full of people who were
  never kind, which turned out to be a bad survival strategy. And how about
  Tribe B and Tribe C? Both look pretty decent so far. But what happens when,
  one day, they run into each other?

<p>Alright, then.</p>
<p>
  Tribe B showed kindness <em>within</em> their giant the same way the organs in
  your body work together and support each other. This behavior emerged not from
  a general <em>principle</em> but as a means to the selfish survival of the
  giant they formed together. On the other hand, Tribe C’s kindness was a core
  value, not confined to any single layer of emergence—it extended upwards into
  the world of giants as well.
</p>
<p>
  So while kindness, in all its manifestations—care, altruism, compassion—was an
  important survival trait in a world where well-functioning groups were
  necessary for survival, universal kindness probably wasn’t a great survival
  trait. Inevitably, other tribes would be selectively kind, shedding all of
  that kindness when dealing with other tribes. And when a kind tribe faces off
  against a ruthless tribe, the ruthless tribe usually wins.
</p>
<p>
  The evolutionary sweet spot probably wouldn’t have been kindness or empathy or
  compassion or cooperation—it would have been to have these traits on a
  <em>toggle switch</em>. To be micro-kind and macro-ruthless.
</p>
<p>
  When I look around, I see evidence of this toggle switch everywhere. Notice
  how easily people who are normally compassionate drop that compassion when
  thinking and talking about members of a political party they hate—the “Them”
  political party? How these people are all about forgiveness with people they
  see as part of “Us” but are fine with permanent, lifelong consequences for
  enemies of that group? How they’re so good at seeing the story behind the
  story when they hear about criminals they consider part of “good guy” groups,
  but always seem to see the worst superficial caricature in wrongdoers from
  groups they don’t identify with? It happens on a smaller scale too, like when
  people who have spent their lives showing no compassion or understanding for a
  certain type of outsider suddenly have a warm heart when someone in their
  family ends up as part of that group.
</p>
<p>
  Selective kindness isn’t high-mindedness. The Higher Mind exhibits these
  traits all the time. He’s high-minded <em>universally</em>, as a general
  principle, and applies it to everyone equally. Selective kindness is a
  Primitive Mind trick that <em>appears </em>to be high-mindedness, if you’re
  not paying close enough attention. Remember, at first glance, ants seemed like
  nice people too. That’s why the litmus test of anyone’s true colors—the
  revealer of which mind is running the show in their head—is how they treat
  people outside their tribe. Both the Higher Mind and Primitive Mind tend to
  treat fellow tribesmen with kindness, so that tells you nothing—it’s when
  dealing with <em>Them</em> that the two minds diverge.
</p>
<p>___________</p>
<p>
  I’ve written about our troubles with the Primitive Mind many times on Wait But
  Why, exploring how it manifests in different forms—as the reason we
  procrastinate, the reason we care so much what others think of us, the reason
  we’re so bad at original thinking, the reason we struggle for self-awareness.
  In each case, the Primitive Mind is just doing what it’s programmed to do—help
  us pass our genes on in 50,000 BC. In each case, our problems stem from the
  fact that we no longer live in the world we were optimized by evolution to
  live in. And in each case, there’s hope to make things better—because right
  next to the Primitive Mind in our heads is an advanced center of clarity and
  wisdom and independent agency. The Higher Mind may be the underdog, but he’s a
  fighter.
</p>
<p>
  When I started thinking about modern tribalism as I wrote this series, it hit
  me that this has a lot in common with those other posts. Because a society’s
  struggles aren’t that different from each of our personal struggles—just like
  two families fighting isn’t that different from two brothers fighting. Society
  and the people who make it up have a fractal relationship—their internal
  problems are of the same nature, just on different emergence floors. At the
  core of both struggles is the mismatch between our ancient programming and the
  advanced civilization we live in.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve always felt hope when writing about our struggles at the individual
  level, and I feel hope in this series too as we look at what’s going on a few
  floors up on the elevator. But we have a pretty daunting task in front of
  us—because innate tribalism is only the beginning of what we’re contending
  with today. Somewhere down the line of human history, evolution happened upon
  a new tool that put human tribalism on steroids. That’s what we’ll explore in
  the next chapter.
