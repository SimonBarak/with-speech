  The problem is that the animal world isn’t really an animal world—it’s a world
  of trillions of strands of genetic information, each one hell-bent on
  immortality. And in a universe that wants to turn order into chaos whenever
  possible, the immortality of anything—let alone a delicate and complex genetic
  code—is a constant uphill battle. Most of Earth’s gene strands don’t last very
  long, and genes that weren’t talented enough at the immortality game are long
  gone. The genes on Earth today are the miracle outliers on both the motivation
  and talent front—such incredible survival specialists that they’re currently
  almost four billion years old and counting.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  Animals are just a hack these outlier genes came up with—temporary containers
  designed to carry the genes and help them stay immortal. If genes could talk
  to their animal, they’d probably issue a few simple commands:

  In simple animals, the software is an automated program that runs the animal
  on instinct. In more complex animals, the software also includes a number of
  <em>feelings—</em>higher-level behavior-manipulation tools like pain
  punishments, pleasure treats, and emotion manipulations.

  When everything is going smoothly, the software will run in the background on
  low-power mode. But at some point, the animal will start to run low on energy,
  so the software will kick into gear and shift the “hunger” setting steadily
  upwards until it eventually overpowers the “tired” setting.

  Life on Earth is a long succession of temporary animal containers passing
  genes along to newer containers like a baton in an endless relay. It’s an odd
  survival system, but so far, it’s worked pretty well—at least for those genes
  still around.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  And that’s great for genes. But it’s stressful for animals.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  The problem is that genes themselves aren’t alive, they’re just a force of
  nature—and forces of nature don’t give a shit about anything. Gravity wants to
  smoosh matter together, so that’s what it does. It has no concern for the
  well-being of the atoms it smooshes. If the hydrogen atoms in the center of
  the sun can’t handle the smooshing, they’ll fuse into helium atoms. Gravity
  doesn’t care. But the important thing is, atoms don’t care either. In the
  center of the sun, no one cares about anything, so everything’s fine.

<p class=" mb-4">
  Genes are like gravity—they don’t care. They want to stay immortal, and
  they’ll pursue that goal as relentlessly as gravity fuses atoms inside stars.
  Just as there’s finite space in the center of a star, there are finite
  resources in the animal world—finite land, finite shelter, finite food, finite
  mates—which makes gene endeavors a zero-sum game. One species doing better
  almost always happens at the expense of other species doing worse. And just
  like gravity relentlessly smooshes, genes are relentlessly greedy—a successful
  species will grow and expand as far as it can until it exhausts its
  advantages.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  When you have a relentless force consuming finite resources, something’s gotta
  give. In a star, atoms give, fusing into bigger atoms. In the animal world,
  animal species give, morphing into new, mutated species—or, more often, going
  extinct.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  So genes are like gravity—but animals aren’t like atoms.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  Mindless evolutionary innovation brought survival tricks like feelings and
  subjective experience and higher sentience into animals, which means animals
  are like atoms in the center of a star…if the atoms <em>hated</em> being
  smooshed.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  To genes, animal suffering is simply a useful tool—so the animal world is full
  of suffering. Genes have no higher principles, so neither does the animal
  world—no such thing as rights, no concept of right or wrong, no concern with
  fairness. Animals woke up in the heat of a universe pressure cooker, playing
  an unwinnable game they never signed up for, and that’s all there is to it.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">At least that’s all there <em>was</em> to it.</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  A few million years ago, the genes that inhabit a particular population of
  great ape started innovating in an unusual way, trying out an animal container
  upgrade that had never quite worked before: super-high intelligence. All
  previous genes had passed up extra high intelligence in their housing because
  it requires a ridiculous amount of energy to maintain. It’s like running a
  small business and considering whether to hire an employee with a rare skill
  set who will only work for $1,000,000 a year. Doesn’t matter how good the
  employee is—no one is worth a million a year to a cash-strapped small
  business. But these ape genes tried it anyway.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  They evolved into a variety of hominid species, all of whom have since been
  discontinued, except one—a saucy one called homo sapiens. For them, the
  advancements in intelligence proved to be a major survival asset, so their
  cognitive capacity rapidly increased, developing into an array of shiny new
  tools that no animal had ever possessed before. Through an accident of
  evolution, humans had gained superpowers.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  They had gained the superpower of reason, which gave humans the ability to
  solve complex problems, invent fancy new technologies, design sophisticated
  strategies, and make real-time adjustments to their thinking based on changes
  in their environment.

  But the real power of imagination came when it was combined with
  communication. Humans now had the power to communicate with each other using a
  complex language full of sounds that represent things or ideas—human language
  is humans imagining <em>together</em>. Communication plus imagination is why
  humans can think in the big picture and make long-term plans in a way no other
  animal can.

  Reason and imagination, combined together, lead to something even more
  incredible. Without imagination, animals have a hard time wrapping their heads
  around the fact that animals other than themselves are full, living creatures
  who experience life just like they do. They can’t put themselves in another
  animal’s shoes. Without reason, animals can’t follow the logic that concludes
  that the lives of others are just as valuable as their own, and their pain and
  pleasure just as real.

  only: genetic immortality. But this new mind was something different
  entirely—something running <em>independently</em> of the human’s survival
  software.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  Not only could this mind within a mind think its own thoughts, it could
  actually <em>overrule </em>the will of the genes, override the software’s
  commands, and drive human behavior.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  For the first time in early life history, an animal was more than just an
  animal—it was an animal plus…something <em>else</em>.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  Let’s call our ancient animal software, which is still very much in our
  heads—our Primitive Mind. And let’s call this highly advanced, independent new
  consciousness our Higher Mind.

<p class=" mb-4">
  As any human you’ll talk to can attest, two minds in one animal is an odd
  situation. Especially since the two minds often don’t get along.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  The Higher Mind is rational, reasonable, and thoughtful. On his staff sits the
  light of higher consciousness, and when the Higher Mind is in the driver’s
  seat of your being, the light fills your mind with clarity and self-awareness.
  Wisdom flows through the Higher Mind’s head, and love and empathy radiate out
  from his heart. When the Higher Mind is doing the thinking in your head, these
  rays pass directly into <em>your</em> mind and heart and light them up with
  the warm glow of high-mindedness.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  The Higher Mind spends most of his time on the right side of the control panel
  with the superpowers, absorbing their energy and feeding them with his
  consciousness.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  When he thinks about it—and he does think about it, sometimes—he wonders
  whether this is all a mistake and he ended up in the wrong head. Because he
  can’t help but notice that next to him at all times is a hectic ball of orange
  fuzz that was living here when he moved in.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  Over the years, the Higher Mind has come to see the Primitive Mind as a
  not-very-smart pet. But he also understands that it’s important to the whole
  system to let the Primitive Mind get what it needs from its little pet life—to
  an extent. The Primitive Mind is endlessly greedy, completely untrainable, and
  the Higher Mind has learned the hard way that the Primitive Mind
  <em>must </em>be kept in check. As the only grown-up in the room, the Higher
  Mind does what he can, trying to keep an eye on the Primitive Mind and make
  sure that whatever it’s doing over there makes sense and fits with the overall
  plan.

  Meanwhile, the Primitive Mind doesn’t know the Higher Mind exists. The
  Primitive Mind doesn’t even know the Primitive Mind exists. The Primitive Mind
  is software—programmed by evolution to serve the will of your genes. In its
  hand, the Primitive Mind carries your primal flame—the raw will of your animal
  genes to survive.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  The Primitive Mind doesn’t care about you any more than gravity cares about
  atoms. It’s just a truck driver delivering precious cargo from one place to
  another—and you’re just the truck. The only concern it has with the truck is
  to keep it well fueled and out of accidents during this segment of the eternal
  voyage. The more prominent the Primitive Mind is in your head at any given
  time, the less you’re like an independent entity and the more you’re like a
  truck being driven by automated software.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  The difficulty with two minds is that there’s only one brain—leaving the two
  minds in an
  <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >ongoing power struggle</a
  >. When the Higher Mind is empowered, his staff lights up the room with
  self-awareness, offering a clear view of the Primitive Mind in all its
  silliness, which makes it hard for the Primitive Mind to do anything sneaky.

  But when the tides turn, the Primitive Mind’s torch grows along with his
  influence, and the room gets increasingly smoky. The more smoke there is, the
  more it blocks the Higher Mind’s light, cutting off his access to his human
  and making it hard for him to do his job.

  The human, with smoke obscuring its self-awareness, doesn’t realize its mind
  has been switched over to software automation, leaving the Higher Mind pretty
  helpless to take back the controls. This is when humans start trouble, for
  themselves and for others.
</p>
<p class=" mb-4">
  The never-ending struggle between these two minds is the human condition. It’s
  the backdrop of everything that has ever happened in the human world, and
  everything that happens today. It’s the story of our times because it’s the
  story of all human times. We’re gonna go to all kinds of places in this post
  series—and wherever we go, remember to remember the great battle of fire and
  light.
