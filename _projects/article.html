    That is why rainfall is very unpredictable across much of the continent, a
    geographic reality to which native species and indigenous people
    adapted.</span

    It so happens that now movements in both ocean weather systems have created
    an especially dry, hot summer, following an already long period of
    drought.</span

    On a brief trip back to Australia before the worst of the fires, being in
    the landscape again made me cry.</span

    across the whole eastern side.</span
  ><span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad69-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    The weather bureau had to add a new color not too long ago for the new
    record highs.</span

    I grew up used to high summer heat, my underpants sticking to me on my
    wooden seat in school, the fans turning too slow, no air conditioning.</span

    channels.</span
  ><span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad6f-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    But how to put that alongside seeing pictures of so much dead wildlife and
    knowing that many species will never recover?</span

</p>
<p>
  <span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad70-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    I think about all those animals, desperate to flee the flames.</span

    My ancestors traveled from Scotland to build gas works for lighting.</span
  ><span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad77-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    For years now, much of settler culture has let itself be gaslit by climate
    denial ideologues in the pay of the fossil fuel industry and promoted by the
    Murdoch press.</span
  ><span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad78-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    We’ve been persuaded to disbelieve our own senses, to neglect the evidence
    that’s been in front of us for years that “development,” such as it is,
    can’t go on without breaking this dry, fragile continent.</span
  ><span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad79-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    Even many of those not so coerced by this had not expected things to start
    falling apart quite so soon.</span

    That the things for which I once fought, back when I lived there, amounted
    to nothing and now can never be.</span

    All I could cling to—a faint glimmer of light in the haze—would be that

    dealing with reality.</span

    The current prime minister, Scott Morrison—referred to by so many these days

    In the town of Bathurst—the seat of the first outpost of the
    nineteenth-century Wark family gasworks business—there’s a street named
    after us:</span

    The white owners claim the place survived the fires because they’d
    commissioned what is called “cultural burning” from an Aboriginal expert in
    the technique.</span
  ><span class="speakable" data-url="21a5ad8b-3ba5-11ea-bd5b-3d9fd061a342">
    It is a practice different from the preventative burning done by fire
    services.</span

    The fires are smaller and don’t reach into the tree canopies, allowing
    wildlife to take refuge up there.</span

    The objective is the same:</span

    Given the punitive, carceral approach the Australian government currently

    climate refugees already, this too might be thought under the rubric of the

    direct action at the point of production.</span
