    In fact, one of the Primitive Mind’s central talents is the ability to
    instinctually merge with other Primitive Minds, combining each of their
    individual primal flames into a raging survival bonfire, making the group

    A couple with little children living alone in a forest in 50,000 BC would

    cooking, breast-feeding, and migrating they needed to do to fulfill their
    basic family needs, all while raising kids.</span

    How they’re so good at seeing the story behind the story when they hear

    It happens on a smaller scale too, like when people who have spent their
    lives showing no compassion or understanding for a certain type of outsider
    suddenly have a warm heart when someone in their family ends up as part of
    that group.</span

    That’s why the litmus test of anyone’s true colors—the revealer of which
    mind is running the show in their head—is how they treat people outside
    their tribe.</span

    Both the Higher Mind and Primitive Mind tend to treat fellow tribesmen with
    kindness, so that tells you nothing—it’s when dealing with Them that the two
    minds diverge.</span
